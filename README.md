This is a repository for my solutions to the
["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview) in C. You can see my progress above.
You can also watch a [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5r5Q39GjMDe5UslVzi2MHcbvkTLw9Pav) where I discuss and code the solutions.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

# Running the program

The entry point for your shell implementation is in `app/main.c`, but you can compile and run it with `your_program.sh`, or `.codecrafters/debug.sh` if you want to go step by step.
